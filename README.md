# Best Egg Engineering Code Challenge

Your task is to build a FastAPI-based microservice that integrates with a mocked third-party package tracking API.

## Prep
- Create a repository using your personal GitHub account âœ…
- Copy the provided docker-compose file and wiremock directory from this repository into your own âœ…
- Run the mock server using docker compose âœ…
    - WireMock will be available at `http://localhost:8080` âœ…

## Your Microservice Should Include

- `GET /packages/{tracking_id}` â€“ Fetch detailed tracking info using the mock API âœ…
- `GET /packages` â€“ Return a list of all known packages âœ…
- Support filtering by status (e.g., `?status=Delivered`) âœ…
- Support sorting by `eta` or `last_updated` (e.g., `?sort=eta`) âœ…
- `GET /carriers` â€“ Return a list of supported carriers from the mock API âœ…

## Requirements

- Use FastAPI with OpenAPI docs enabled at `/docs` âœ…
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation âœ…
- Include unit tests with `pytest` âœ…

## Stretch Goals

- Join data from `/tracking/{id}` and `/locations/{city}` to enrich the tracking response with city metadata âœ…
- Implement integration testing
- Retry failed requests (e.g., 500 responses) with backoff
- Add pagination or result limiting
- Add something not listed above! A differentiator that will make your project stand out

## Notes

- You may use any tools you'd use day-to-day (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)
- You may add additional data to the mocked API to demonstrate your project's capabilities, but preserve the core endpoints and structure
- You'll walk through your implementation with us during the interview
- You may be asked to implement additional enhancements during the inteview, be prepared to share your screen and work on your code

## Notes From Dylan

To anyone reading this at Best Egg, thank you so much for taking the time to review my code! I'm new to Python but I had a lot of fun making this project and learning a lot about Python basics along the way. I wanted to accomplish a little more as far as stretch goals go but I'm happy with where I ended up, and I hope that excitement/satisfaction comes through in the code!
